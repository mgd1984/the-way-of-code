# The Way of Code

*Ancient principles for modern systems*

## Philosophy

### The Five Pillars
**Simplicity** over complexity  
**Flow** over force  
**Humility** over ego  
**Balance** over extremes  
**Presence** over rushing

Code emerges from understanding. Understanding emerges from practice.

## Architecture

### MCP Server
**Package**: `the-way-of-code`  
**Protocol**: Model Context Protocol  
**Install**: `npx the-way-of-code`

### Tools
```typescript
get_chapter(chapter: 1..81)      // Direct access to any chapter
search_principles(query)         // Find relevant wisdom  
get_core_principles()            // The five essential pillars
```

### Resource
```
way://chapters/all               // Complete collection (JSON)
```

---

## Implementation

### Integration
```bash
npx the-way-of-code
```

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "the-way-of-code": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["the-way-of-code"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Usage
```typescript
// Get specific wisdom
await mcp.call('get_chapter', { chapter: 8 });

// Search for guidance
await mcp.call('search_principles', { query: 'debugging' });

// Core principles
await mcp.call('get_core_principles', {});

// Access all chapters
await mcp.readResource('way://chapters/all');
```

## Principles

### Code Organization
Structure emerges from constraints. Complexity serves necessity, not cleverness.

### Problem Solving
Create space for solutions to arise. The master debugger does not force clarity—they allow it to emerge.

### Collaboration
Lead through questions. Resolve conflicts through understanding. Share knowledge without seeking credit.

### Development Practice
"The master carves his block, slowly but surely."

Every commit is both progress and practice. Code toward perfection while accepting imperfection.

## Structure

**THE_WAY_OF_CODE.md** — Complete wisdom, 81 chapters  
**mcp-server/** — Technical implementation  
**examples.md** — Essential templates
**.cursor/** — Development rules

The source adapts to every container while remaining unchanged.
