# JavaScript Development - The Way of Code

## Code Style
- Write code that reads like natural language
- Prefer explicit over implicit when it aids understanding
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused on single responsibilities

## Error Handling
- Handle errors gracefully with clear messages
- Provide helpful context in error messages
- Fail fast when appropriate, recover gracefully when possible
- Log errors in a way that aids debugging

## Module Organization
- Export only what needs to be public
- Keep related functionality together
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Organize by feature, not by technical layer

## Node.js Specific
- Use modern ES modules when possible
- Handle async operations with care
- Validate inputs at module boundaries
- Keep dependencies minimal and purposeful

## Scripts and Utilities
- Make scripts self-documenting with clear help text
- Handle edge cases and provide useful error messages
- Follow Unix philosophy: do one thing well
- Make scripts idempotent when possible
