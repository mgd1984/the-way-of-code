# Cursor Rules - The Way of Code

*"True perfection seems imperfect, yet it is perfectly itself"* - Chapter 45

These rules embody **Balance Over Extremes** - rich wisdom distilled to essential guidance.

## Philosophy of Rules

The Way of Code rules are not restrictions but **philosophical APIs** - elegant abstractions that make ancient wisdom accessible to modern development. They guide without constraining, teach without preaching, and evolve through practice.

## Core Rules (Always Applied)
- `core-philosophy.mdc` - The five pillars: our eternal foundation
- `meta-rules.mdc` - How rules themselves follow The Way

## Auto-Applied Rules (by file pattern)
- `languages.mdc` - TypeScript/JavaScript/Shell mastery through ancient wisdom
- `development.mdc` - Coding practices rooted in timeless principles
- `documentation.mdc` - Writing that serves understanding over ego

## Manual Rules (invoke with @rule-name)
- `collaboration.mdc` - Code review and team harmony
- `gitmcp-integration.mdc` - GitMCP.io integration wisdom
- `releases.mdc` - Release process with purposeful flow

## Philosophical Architecture

### File Pattern Coverage
| Domain | Pattern | Rule Applied | Chapter Wisdom |
|--------|---------|--------------|----------------|
| All Languages | `**/*.{ts,tsx,js,mjs,sh,bash}` | `languages.mdc` | "Truthful words are not beautiful" |
| Development | `mcp-server/**/*`, configs | `development.mdc` | "The master carves his block, slowly" |
| Documentation | `**/*.md`, `text/**/*`, examples | `documentation.mdc` | "True fullness seems empty" |

### The Trinity of Guidance
- **What is** - Eternal principles that never change
- **How to** - Practical applications that adapt to context  
- **Why** - Understanding that connects ancient wisdom to modern needs

## Usage as Practice

### Natural Integration
- Core philosophy flows through all interactions like water
- File-specific rules auto-attach when relevant context appears
- Manual rules (`@rule-name`) provide deeper guidance on demand
- Rules evolve through use while maintaining essential truth

### The Path of Continuous Refinement
- Rules simplify through abstraction, not reduction
- Each iteration reveals clearer expression of timeless principles
- Complexity serves understanding, never programmer ego
- Evolution follows the middle path - neither adding nor removing unnecessarily

*"The Tao that can be spoken is not the eternal Tao"* - These rules point toward wisdom; practice reveals the way.
