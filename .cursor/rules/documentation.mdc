# Documentation - The Way of Code

## Writing Philosophy
- Write for the reader, not the writer
- Explain the "why" before the "how"
- Use simple, clear language
- Let understanding emerge naturally

## Structure
- Start with the essential concept
- Build complexity gradually
- Use examples that illuminate principles
- End with practical applications

## Markdown Best Practices
- Use consistent heading hierarchy
- Include code examples that actually work
- Link to related concepts when helpful
- Keep paragraphs focused and scannable

## The Way of Code Documentation
- Balance philosophical depth with practical utility
- Include both ancient wisdom and modern applications
- Make principles immediately actionable
- Connect abstract concepts to concrete coding practices

## Examples and Scenarios
- Use real-world coding situations
- Show both the problem and the solution
- Explain the principle behind the approach
- Demonstrate the natural flow of good code

## Maintenance
- Keep documentation current with code changes
- Remove outdated information promptly
- Update examples to reflect best practices
- Ensure consistency across all documentation
