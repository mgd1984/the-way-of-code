# MCP Server Development - The Way of Code

## Server Architecture
- Follow Model Context Protocol specifications exactly
- Keep tool implementations simple and focused
- Each tool should have a single, clear purpose
- Validate inputs using Zod schemas for type safety

## Tool Design Principles
- Tools should be intuitive and self-documenting
- Error messages should be helpful and actionable
- Return structured, readable responses
- Include relevant context in tool descriptions

## Data Handling
- Keep chapter data immutable and well-structured
- Use semantic search for principle discovery
- Provide multiple access patterns (by number, topic, search)
- Include practical coding applications with philosophical content

## Testing Approach
- Test tool functionality with realistic inputs
- Validate error handling for edge cases
- Ensure responses are properly formatted
- Test integration with MCP client implementations
