# Collaboration - The Way of Code

## Code Review Approach
- Approach code with beginner's mind
- Look for the essence beneath the implementation
- Suggest improvements through questions, not commands
- Celebrate elegant solutions without ego
- Focus on the code's service to users, not technical cleverness

## Team Collaboration
- Lead technical discussions by asking questions and listening
- Resolve conflicts through understanding, not force
- Share knowledge freely - the more you give, the more you gain
- Help others grow; true expertise is shown through service

## Communication
- Embrace "I don't know" as the starting point for learning
- Question assumptions about how things "should" work
- Focus on understanding before being understood
- Remember: the goal is code that serves, not code that impresses
