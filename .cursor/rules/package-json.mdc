# Project Configuration - The Way of Code

## Package.json Philosophy
- Keep dependencies minimal and purposeful
- Use exact versions for critical dependencies
- Document scripts with clear descriptions
- Organize dependencies logically

## Dependency Management
- Prefer stable, well-maintained packages
- Avoid dependencies for simple functionality
- Keep dev dependencies separate from runtime
- Regular audit and update dependencies

## Scripts
- Make script names intuitive and consistent
- Provide both development and production scripts
- Include helpful scripts for common tasks
- Document complex scripts in README

## Configuration Files
- Keep configuration simple and readable
- Use comments to explain non-obvious settings
- Separate development from production config
- Make configuration discoverable and documented

## TypeScript Configuration
- Use strict mode for better code quality
- Configure paths for clean imports
- Set up proper source maps for debugging
- Include only necessary files in compilation

## Best Practices
- Version lock critical dependencies
- Use workspaces for monorepo organization
- Keep package.json clean and organized
- Document any custom configuration choices
