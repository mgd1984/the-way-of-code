# Releases - The Way of Purposeful Flow

*"When the work is done, let it go. Complete without attachment."* - Chapter 17

## Release Philosophy
Balance between new features and stability. Clear purpose behind each version bump. Neither rushing nor holding back unnecessarily.

## Semantic Versioning
- **Patch (x.x.1)**: Bug fixes, refinements
- **Minor (x.1.x)**: New features, enhancements  
- **Major (1.x.x)**: Breaking changes, architectural evolution

## Release Process
1. **Preparation** - Review changes, update versions, test completely
2. **Commit** - Craft meaningful messages, stage atomically
3. **GitHub Release** - Tell the story of evolution with context
4. **NPM Publication** - Verify, test, monitor

## Release Note Structure
1. Opening - Brief philosophical context
2. Evolution - What has grown and changed
3. Technical Details - Specific improvements
4. Integration - How this affects users
5. Gratitude - Acknowledgment of the journey

## Files to Update
- `mcp-server/package.json` - Primary version source
- `mcp-server/src/index.ts` - Server version declaration
- Release notes and documentation

*"Each release is both completion and beginning"*
