# TypeScript Development - The Way of Code

## Type Design
- Prefer simple, clear type definitions over complex ones
- Use union types and discriminated unions for clarity
- Let TypeScript infer types when it's obvious
- Create types that express intent, not just structure

## Error Handling
- Use Result types or proper error boundaries
- Validate at system boundaries with runtime checks
- Prefer explicit error handling over throwing exceptions
- Make error states visible in the type system

## Code Organization
- Keep modules focused and cohesive
- Export only what needs to be public
- Use barrel exports sparingly
- Organize by feature, not by file type

## Best Practices
- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Prefer `const` assertions for immutable data
- Use Zod or similar for runtime validation
- Write code that reads naturally, even with types
