# Shell Scripts - The Way of Code

## Script Philosophy
- Make scripts that flow naturally
- Handle errors gracefully, not forcefully
- Provide clear feedback to users
- Fail fast when something is wrong

## Best Practices
- Use `set -euo pipefail` for safety
- Quote variables to prevent word splitting
- Check for required dependencies before proceeding
- Provide helpful error messages with context

## User Experience
- Show progress for long-running operations
- Ask for confirmation on destructive actions
- Provide clear success/failure feedback
- Include helpful usage information

## Installation Scripts
- Check system compatibility first
- Create backups before making changes
- Allow for graceful rollback on failure
- Test in clean environments

## Git Hooks
- Keep hooks fast and focused
- Provide clear feedback on what failed
- Allow developers to bypass when necessary
- Document what each hook does and why

## Error Handling
- Trap errors and clean up properly
- Provide actionable error messages
- Log enough information for debugging
- Exit with appropriate status codes
