# Practical Examples

*"The way is shown, not explained."*

---

## Daily Practice

```bash
# When you're stuck
npx the-way-of-code

# When debugging is making you question reality
npx the-way-of-code search "debugging"

# When architecture feels overwhelming
npx the-way-of-code search "simplicity"
```

**The pattern**: Get unstuck by stepping back. The answer is usually simpler than you think.

## Code Review That Doesn't Suck

### Ask better questions

Instead of: *"Why didn't you use a factory pattern here?"*  
Try: *"What would happen if this needs to change?"*

Instead of: *"This is inefficient."*  
Try: *"What's the bottleneck we're optimizing for?"*

Instead of: *"Use more descriptive variable names."*  
Try: *"Help me understand what this represents."*

### The five lenses

**Simplicity** — Can this be understood at 2am?  
**Flow** — Does it fight the language or work with it?  
**Humility** — Will the next person get it?  
**Balance** — Are the tradeoffs conscious?  
**Presence** — Does it solve the actual problem?

### MCP integration

```javascript
const guidance = await client.invoke("the-way-of-code", "search_principles", {
  query: "code review feedback"
});

// Use the principles to guide your feedback
```

Remember: Good code review improves the code. Great code review teaches the coder.

## Debugging Without Losing Your Mind

### The debug spiral

1. **Stop** — Walk away from the screen
2. **Breathe** — Your frustration is lying to you  
3. **Simplify** — What's the smallest thing that could be wrong?
4. **Test** — Prove your assumptions
5. **Repeat** — Until you find the lie

### Ancient debug wisdom

- Complex bugs hide in simple places
- Simple bugs hide in complex places  
- The bug you can't find immediately is testing your patience, not your skill
- When you stop looking so hard, you start seeing clearly

```bash
# When tempted to add more console.logs
npx the-way-of-code get_chapter 48  # "Less and less is done until non-action is achieved"
```

## Architecture Decisions

### Before you build

Ask yourself:
- What problem am I actually solving?
- What would this look like if it were simple?
- How will this age?
- What would I do with infinite time? With zero time?

### The architecture questions

**Right now**: What's the simplest thing that could work?  
**6 months**: What patterns are starting to emerge?  
**2 years**: What needs to change without breaking everything?

```javascript
// Before making big architectural choices
const wisdom = await client.invoke("the-way-of-code", "search_principles", {
  query: "architecture"
});
```

### Remember

- Start with constraints, not abstractions
- Good architecture feels inevitable afterwards
- The best system is the one you don't have to think about

## Working with AI

### The new pair programming

**You shape the thought. AI shapes the syntax.**

Ask your AI pair:
- "What would the simplest version look like?"
- "How might this break in unexpected ways?"  
- "What am I not seeing here?"
- "Is there a more direct approach?"

### Integration wisdom

```javascript
// Start each AI session with context
const principle = await client.invoke("the-way-of-code", "get_core_principles");

const context = `
Keep these principles in mind: ${principle}

Now let's solve this problem...
`;
```

### The balance

- Trust the AI for boilerplate
- Trust yourself for design decisions
- Trust both of you for complex problems
- Trust neither of you for production shortcuts

---

## Team Dynamics

### Better standup questions

Instead of: *"What did you do yesterday?"*  
Try: *"What did you learn yesterday?"*

Instead of: *"What will you do today?"*  
Try: *"What wants to emerge today?"*

Instead of: *"Any blockers?"*  
Try: *"What are you forcing that wants to flow?"*

### Leading without controlling

- Show, don't tell
- Question, don't lecture  
- Guide, don't dictate
- Trust, don't micromanage

From Chapter 17: *"When the work is accomplished, the team says, 'Amazing. We did it all ourselves.'"*

## Deployment and Release

### Before you ship

1. **Review** with fresh eyes — What would confuse me in 6 months?
2. **Test** the unhappy path — What breaks when users do weird things?
3. **Deploy** without attachment — It's out of your hands now
4. **Monitor** with presence — Watch what actually happens
5. **Learn** from reality — Users always surprise you

### Release mantras

- "Perfect is the enemy of shipped"
- "Done is better than perfect"  
- "You can't debug what you don't deploy"
- "The code now belongs to the world"

```bash
# Before hitting deploy
npx the-way-of-code search "letting go"
```

## Learning New Tech

### Beginner's mind

- Approach each new framework like you know nothing
- Ask the obvious questions
- Be comfortable with confusion
- Celebrate small understanding

### The learning paradox

The more you know, the more you realize you don't know. This is feature, not a bug.

```bash
# When feeling overwhelmed by new tech
npx the-way-of-code search "beginner"

# When feeling like you should know everything
npx the-way-of-code search "humility"
```

### Remember

Mastery isn't a destination. It's a quality of attention.

## Final Thoughts

These aren't rules to follow blindly. They're patterns that tend to work when you're stuck, stressed, or spiraling.

Use what helps. Ignore what doesn't. Adapt everything.

The best practice is the one that emerges naturally from your actual work.
