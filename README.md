## Install

```bash
npx the-way-of-code
```

## Configure

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "the-way-of-code": {
      "command": "npx", 
      "args": ["the-way-of-code"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Use

The principles guide the code. The code embodies the principles.

---

## Philosophy

### The Five Pillars

**Simplicity** over complexity  
**Flow** over force  
**Humility** over ego  
**Balance** over extremes  
**Presence** over rushing

### The Practice

Code emerges from silence. Problems dissolve in understanding. Architecture flows from constraints, not abstractions.

The master debugger does not force solutions—they create space for clarity to arise.

---

## Implementation

**Tools** — Five focused instruments  
**Resources** — Structured wisdom  
**Prompts** — Essential workflows

Each primitive serves its nature. Together, they form a complete system.

```typescript
// The tools
get_chapter(n: 1..81)
search_principles(query: string)
get_principles_by_topic(topic: Topic)
get_core_principles()
get_philosophical_context(aspect?: Aspect)
```

No more than necessary. No less than sufficient.

## The Text

**[THE_WAY_OF_CODE.md](./THE_WAY_OF_CODE.md)** — Complete wisdom, 81 chapters

The source adapts to every container while remaining unchanged.

---

## Examples

Scenarios that illuminate practice:
- **[Prompts](./examples/prompts/)** — Templates for common situations  
- **[Scenarios](./examples/scenarios/)** — Real-world applications

The way is shown, not explained.

## Contributing

Approach with beginner's mind.  
Question before asserting.  
Serve the code, not the ego.

*"Do by not doing, and there is nothing that cannot be done."*
