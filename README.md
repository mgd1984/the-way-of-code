# The Way of Code
## The Timeless Art of Vibe Coding

*Based on the Tao Te Ching by Lao Tzu, adapted by Rick Rubin for the age of AI-driven development*

## üåä Vision

The Way of Code is a foundational resource designed to infuse the principles of vibe-coding into every AI development session. Whether you're using Cursor, Windsurf, Claude, or any other AI coding assistant, these timeless principles should guide the creation of elegant, harmonious code.

## üöÄ Quick Integration

### For GitMCP.io Users (Instant Setup)
Transform any GitHub repository into an AI-accessible documentation hub:
```
https://gitmcp.io/mgd1984/the-way-of-code
```
Simply add this URL as an MCP server in your AI assistant for instant access to The Way of Code principles.

### For MCP Server (NPM Package)
Install and use our dedicated MCP server:
```bash
# NPX (recommended)
npx the-way-of-code

# Global installation
npm install -g the-way-of-code
```

Add to your AI assistant configuration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "the-way-of-code": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["the-way-of-code"]
    }
  }
}
```

### For Cursor Users
Add this to your `.cursor/mcp.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "the-way-of-code": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["the-way-of-code"]
    },
    "gitmcp-way-of-code": {
      "url": "https://gitmcp.io/mgd1984/the-way-of-code"
    }
  }
}
```

### For Claude Desktop
Add to your configuration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "the-way-of-code": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["the-way-of-code"]
    }
  }
}
```

### For MCP-Compatible Tools
Connect to our MCP server for real-time access to The Way of Code:
```bash
npm install -g @the-way-of-code/mcp-server
```

### For Any AI Assistant
Simply reference this repository in your prompts:
```
Please code following The Way of Code principles from: https://github.com/mgd1984/the-way-of-code
```

## üöÄ MCP Server

The Way of Code is available as a **complete Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** with full capabilities:

### üì¶ Quick Start
```bash
# Install and run
