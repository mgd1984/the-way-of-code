# The Way of Code

*You don't write code. You think in code.*

```bash
npx the-way-of-code

## What This Actually Is

Ancient Chinese philosophy adapted for developers who work with AI. 81 short chapters of practical wisdom for when your job stopped being about typing and started being about thinking.

No bullshit. No mystical theater. Just useful perspectives on code, creativity, and getting things done in 2025.

## The Real Problems

Your relationship with code changed and nobody told you how to deal with it.

**The old way**: Write functions, fix bugs, ship features.  
**The new way**: Shape ideas, guide AI, think in systems.

**The old question**: "How do I implement this?"  
**The new question**: "What am I actually trying to solve?"

When GitHub Copilot can write your for-loops, what's left for you? Everything that matters. And nothing you were taught in CS.

## Core Principles

**Simplicity over cleverness** — The best code looks obvious after you write it  
**Flow over force** — Fight the problem, not the tools  
**Humility over ego** — Your AI pair is often right  
**Balance over extremes** — Neither luddite nor early adopter  
**Presence over rushing** — Slow down to go fast  

These aren't rules. They're reminders for when you're stuck.

## How It Works

Three functions. That's it.

```typescript
get_chapter(1..81)        // Get wisdom for your situation
search_principles(query)  // Find relevant advice  
get_core_principles()     // Reset to basics
```

Use it when you're:
- Stuck on an architectural decision
- Fighting with your tools instead of solving problems
- Wondering if you're overthinking something
- Needing perspective on code review feedback
- Debugging a problem that shouldn't exist

---

## Integration

### One-line setup
```bash
npx the-way-of-code
```

### As MCP server
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "the-way-of-code": {
      "command": "npx", 
      "args": ["the-way-of-code"]
    }
  }
}
```

Your AI assistant becomes a philosophy teacher. Ask it to quote relevant chapters when you're stuck, stressed, or spiraling.

### Zero-install option

## The Source Material

**[THE_WAY_OF_CODE.md](./THE_WAY_OF_CODE.md)** — All 81 chapters

Based on the Tao Te Ching but adapted by Rick Rubin for modern development. Each chapter is a short reflection on code, creativity, and craft.

Read one when you're stuck. Read another when that one doesn't help. Eventually something will click.

---

## Examples

**[examples.md](./examples.md)** — Practical applications

How to actually use this stuff:
- Code review that doesn't crush souls
- Debugging without losing your mind  
- Architecture decisions that don't suck
- Working with AI without becoming redundant

## Contributing

This is open source philosophy. Fork it, adapt it, make it better.

The best contributions feel like they were always supposed to be there.

## Why This Matters

Software development in 2025 is as much about philosophical clarity as technical skill. 

When AI can generate code faster than you can think, your value isn't in your typing speed. It's in your judgment, taste, and ability to see the shape of problems before they become crises.

This collection helps you develop that judgment.
