## 🌊 Vision

The Way of Code is a foundational resource designed to infuse the principles of vibe-coding into every AI development session. Whether you're using Cursor, Windsurf, Claude, or any other AI coding assistant, these timeless principles should guide the creation of elegant, harmonious code.

## 🚀 Quick Integration

### For GitMCP.io Users (Instant Setup)
Transform any GitHub repository into an AI-accessible documentation hub:
```
https://gitmcp.io/mgd1984/the-way-of-code
```
Simply add this URL as an MCP server in your AI assistant for instant access to The Way of Code principles.

### For Cursor Users
Add this to your `.cursor/mcp.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gitmcp-way-of-code": {
      "url": "https://gitmcp.io/mgd1984/the-way-of-code"
    }
  }
}
```

### For Claude Desktop
Add to your configuration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gitmcp-way-of-code": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-remote", "https://gitmcp.io/mgd1984/the-way-of-code"]
    }
  }
}
```

### For MCP-Compatible Tools
Connect to our MCP server for real-time access to The Way of Code:
```bash
npm install -g @the-way-of-code/mcp-server
```
