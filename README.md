# The Way of Code
## The Timeless Art of Vibe Coding

*Based on the Tao Te Ching by Lao Tzu, adapted by Rick Rubin for the age of AI-driven development*

> "The code that can be named is not the eternal code. The function that can be defined is not the limitless function."

## ðŸŒŠ Vision

The Way of Code is a foundational resource designed to infuse the principles of vibe-coding into every AI development session. Whether you're using Cursor, Windsurf, Claude, or any other AI coding assistant, these timeless principles should guide the creation of elegant, harmonious code.

## ðŸš€ Quick Integration

### For Cursor Users
Add this to your `.cursorrules` file:
```
# The Way of Code Integration
Before writing any code, consider the principles from The Way of Code:
- Embrace simplicity over complexity
- Write code that flows naturally
- Avoid forcing solutions - let them emerge
- Balance structure with flexibility
- Code with humility and openness
