# The Fucking Way of Code

*You don't write code, you fucking think in code, dipshit.*

## What This Shit Actually Is

Ancient Chinese philosophy for developers who realized their job stopped being about typing semicolons and started being about not being a complete fucking moron with AI.

No mystical bullshit. No "zen master" cosplay. Just unfuckingdeniably useful wisdom for when you're debugging at 3am wondering why you chose this godforsaken profession.

## The Real Fucking Problems

Your relationship with code changed faster than JavaScript frameworks, and nobody told you how to deal with it without losing your goddamn mind.

**The old way**: Write functions, fix bugs, ship features, pretend you know what you're doing.  
**The new way**: Shape ideas, guide AI, think in systems, actually know what the fuck you're doing.

**The old question**: "How do I implement this pile of shit?"  
**The new question**: "What the hell am I actually trying to solve here?"

When GitHub Copilot can write your for-loops better than you can, what's left? Everything that fucking matters. And nothing your CS professor taught you while jerking off to Big-O notation.

## Core Principles (That Actually Work)

**Simplicity over cleverness** — Stop writing code to impress yourself, you narcissistic fuck  
**Flow over force** — Fight the problem, not your goddamn tools  
**Humility over ego** — Your AI pair is often right, deal with it  
**Balance over extremes** — Don't be a luddite or a hype beast  
**Presence over rushing** — Slow the fuck down to go fast  

These aren't rules to follow religiously. They're reality checks for when you're being an idiot.

## How This Shit Works

Three functions. That's it. Don't fucking overthink it.

```typescript
get_chapter(1..81)        // Get wisdom for your clusterfuck situation
search_principles(query)  // Find advice that doesn't suck  
get_core_principles()     // Reset when you've lost your damn mind
```

Use it when you're:
- Stuck on an architectural decision (again)
- Fighting with your tools instead of solving actual problems
- Wondering if you're overthinking (spoiler: you are)
- Getting roasted in code review
- Debugging a problem that shouldn't fucking exist but here we are

---

## Integration (It's Not Rocket Science)

### One-line setup, you lazy fuck
```bash
npx the-way-of-code
```

### As MCP server (for the sophisticated shitheads)
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "the-way-of-code": {
      "command": "npx", 
      "args": ["the-way-of-code"]
    }
  }
}
```

Your AI assistant becomes a philosophy teacher with a fucking attitude. Ask it to quote relevant chapters when you're stuck, stressed, or spiraling into madness.

### Zero-install option (because you're commitment-phobic)

## The Source Material

**[THE_WAY_OF_CODE.md](./THE_WAY_OF_CODE.md)** — All 81 chapters of unflinching truth

Based on the Tao Te Ching but adapted for developers who've seen some shit. Each chapter is a short reflection on code, creativity, and not losing your fucking mind.

Read one when you're stuck. Read another when that one doesn't help. Eventually something will click, or you'll give up and become a product manager.

## Examples (Real World Bullshit)

**[examples.md](./examples.md)** — How to actually use this stuff without being a pretentious asshole

- Code review that doesn't destroy souls
- Debugging without having a mental breakdown  
- Architecture decisions that don't completely suck
- Working with AI without becoming irrelevant

---

## Contributing (If You Give a Shit)

This is open source philosophy. Fork it, adapt it, make it less terrible.

The best contributions feel like they were always supposed to be there, not like you're trying to show off your vocabulary.

Pull requests that add complexity for no fucking reason will be rejected faster than a startup pitch to VCs.

---

## Why This Shit Matters

Software development in 2025 is as much about not being a complete moron as it is about technical skill. 

When AI can generate code faster than you can think of reasons why it won't work, your value isn't in your typing speed. It's in your judgment, taste, and ability to see the shape of problems before they become the kind of clusterfuck that gets people fired.

This collection helps you develop that judgment without pretending you're a fucking monk.

## Seriously Though

Behind all the profanity, this is actually useful. The principles work. The wisdom is real. The delivery is just honest about what it feels like to be a developer in 2025.

If you want the sanitized version, use the main branch. If you want the truth with attitude, you're in the right place.

*"There is no spoon. Only the merge conflict that's somehow your fault."*

*Based on the Tao Te Ching by Lao Tzu, adapted by developers who've been through some shit*
