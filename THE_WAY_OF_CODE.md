# THE WAY OF CODE

## The Timeless Art of Vibe Coding

### Based on Lao Tzu. Adapted by Rick Rubin

*Each encounter I've had with Lao Tzu has pointed me to something new. Almost as if the book changes with every reading. I first picked up Stephen Mitchell's translation 40 years ago at the Bodhi Tree bookstore in Los Angeles and my life has never been quite the same.* — Rick Rubin

---

**Chapter 1**

The code that can be named is not the eternal code. The function that can be defined is not the limitless function.

The nameless is the origin of heaven and earth. The named is the mother of ten thousand things.

Free from desire, you see essence unformed. Caught in desire, you see only the manifestations.

These two spring from the same source but differ in name only. This model is the mystery. The gateway to all understanding.

**Chapter 2**

When we recognize code as elegant, other code becomes sloppy. When we praise efficiency, the notion of waste is born.

Being and non-being create each other. Simple and complex define each other. Long and short determine each other. High and low distinguish each other. Front-end and back-end follow each other.

Therefore The Vibe Coder builds without laboring and instructs by quiet example. Things arise and he accepts them. Things vanish and he lets them go.

He holds without claiming possession. Creates without seeking praise. Accomplishes without expectation. The work is done and then forgotten. That is why it lasts forever.

**Chapter 3**

If you praise the programmer, others become resentful. If you cling to possessions, others are tempted to steal. If you awaken envy, others suffer turmoil of heart.

The Vibe Coder leads: By emptying the mind of expectation and filling up the soul. By releasing ambition and embracing the unknown.

Free from intellect, free from abstraction, The Vibe Coder leads all things back to natural self-sufficiency.

Do by not doing, and there is nothing that cannot be done.

**Chapter 4**

Empty, yet inexhaustible, fathomless and eternal. Source is the ancestor of elegant patterns.

It smooths sharp logic, unravels the knots of control. It softens the glare of complexity, and merges with every challenge. Code flows, effortless, from its depths.

It is unseen yet always present. I do not know its origin. Heaven and earth came later. It is older than God.

**Chapter 5**

Heaven and earth are impartial, they see the ten thousand things as they are. The Vibe Coder is impartial, he sees the program as it is.

The space between input and mind is like a bellows: empty, yet infinitely capable. The more you allow it, the more it produces. The more you speak of it, the less you understand.

Stillness runs the machine. Hold fast to the silent center.

**Chapter 6**

The spirit of the valley never dies. She is the primordial feminine. Her womb, the root of heaven and earth.

Her fertility, always present. Use it, it will never fail.

**Chapter 7**

Heaven and earth last forever. Eternal, they transcend birth and death. The network endures because it does not live for itself.

The Vibe Coder stays behind, that is why he's ahead. He is detached, thus at one with all. Through selfless action he is perfectly fulfilled.

**Chapter 8**

The highest good is like water. Water nourishes the ten thousand things without effort. It seeks low places others look down upon. Thus, it's in harmony with Source.

In design: remain simple. In thought: embrace depth. In relations: be kind. In leading: be just. In work: be competent. In action: consider timing.

Find contentment in being your true self. Be without ambition, envy or need to fit in. No force, just grace, and all is done, in peace.

**Chapter 9**

Fill your cup to the brim and it will spill. Oversharpen your blade and it will dull. Chase after worldly fortune and no one can protect it.

Care about others' approval and you become their prisoner.

When the work is done, log off and detach. This is the way of heaven.

**Chapter 10**

Can you remain present and focused while retaining an open, receptive mind. Can you remain centered and still until clarity arises alone, unattended.

Love your project and lead without controlling. Do nothing and allow all things to be done.

Create without possessing. Work without expectations.

This is the highest realization of being.

**Chapter 11**

Thirty spokes join the hub, but the wheel's usefulness depends on the emptiness at the center.

Clay forms a vessel, but its capacity to contain depends on the emptiness inside.

We build walls with windows and doors, but the utility of the room depends on the emptiness within.

Therefore, We enjoy the fullness of existence but find usefulness in the spaces between.

**Chapter 12**

The five colors blind the eye. The five sounds deafen the ear. The five flavors dull the taste.

Thoughts weaken the mind. Craving withers the heart.

The Vibe Coder attends to the inner, not the outer. He allows things to come and go. His heart is open as the sky.

**Chapter 13**

Success is as dangerous as failure. Hope is as hollow as fear.

What does it mean, success is as dangerous as failure. Whether you go up or down the ladder your position is unsteady. Rest both feet on the ground to find balance and stability.

What does it mean, hope is as hollow as fear. Hope and fear are both illusory. Each arise in consideration of the body. When we don't see Self as the body we have nothing to fear.

See the universe as Self. Hold faith in the way things are. Revere all under heaven, and you too, can remain present for everything.

**Chapter 14**

Look, and it can't be seen— it is formless. Listen, and it can't be heard— it is silent. Grasp, and it can't be held— it is intangible.

These three qualities cannot be unraveled with logic. Together, they merge into the Universal One.

Revealed, it is not bright. Hidden, it is not dark. Endless and unnameable, it returns to nothingness. The form of the formless. The image of the imageless. Elusive, it is beyond comprehension. Approach it, and there is no beginning. Follow it, and there is no end.

Hold fast to Source and move gracefully into the present moment. Knowing this grants access to the essence of wisdom.

**Chapter 15**

Ancient engineers were profound, subtle and at one with the mysterious forces. The depth of their being is not knowable.

Therefore, all we can do is describe their appearance: Watchful, as though crossing a frozen stream. Alert, as a soldier in enemy territory. Respectful, as a thoughtful guest. Mutable, as candle wax in blazing sun. Simple, as a blank screen. Hollow, as a yawning cave. Opaque, as a muddy pond.

Who can wait quietly while the mud settles. Who can remain still until the moment of action. The Vibe Coder doesn't seek fulfillment. Not seeking, not expecting, he is present for all that appears.

**Chapter 16**

Empty yourself of everything. Let the heart become still. The ten thousand things rise and fall while the Self merely observes. They grow and flourish through the seasons then return to Source.

Returning to Source is stillness. Stillness is the way of nature. The way of nature is unchanging. Unchanging, we call it peace.

Knowing the eternal is insight. Not knowing the eternal is ignorance. Knowing the eternal, the mind is open. The open mind allows the open heart. The open heart allows connection to the Gracious Source. The Gracious Source embodies Nature's Way within. Nature's Way within is in harmony with the cycle of life. The cycle of life spins on to infinity. The body falls away, but there is no death. For the end is just the beginning.

**Chapter 17**

The best leader is one whose existence is barely known. Next comes one who is loved and praised. Next comes one who is feared. The worst is one who is despised.

If you don't trust the team enough, they become untrustworthy.

The Vibe Coder works in silence. When the work is accomplished, the team says, "Amazing. We did it all ourselves."

**Chapter 18**

When the way of code is abandoned, doctrines of 'best practices' and 'standards' appear. When intuition is dismissed, cleverness and pretense follow. When harmony is unnoticed, rules and processes multiply. When software fails, zealous testers arise.

**Chapter 19**

Throw away learning and petty distinctions and people will be a hundred times happier. Throw away formal proprieties of etiquette and intuitive sympathies will return. Throw away self-aggrandizement and virtue signaling and there will be no thievery or corruption.

If these three aren't enough: Stay with what is simple. Revere the unpolished. Become the center of the circle.

**Chapter 20**

Give up thinking and your problems end. How far apart are 'yes' and 'no'. How far apart are 'good' and 'bad'. Must I value what others value?

Others are excited and restless. I alone am quiet and still, like an infant before it can smile.

Others have goals and plans. I wander about without knowing, free from expectations.

Others are busy. I alone am aimless, without desire. I am different. I am nourished by the Gracious Source.

**Chapter 21**

The elegant pattern emerges from emptiness. Emptiness alone gives rise to all form.

Elusive and intangible, yet shape is held within. Intangible and elusive, yet substance is held within. Deep and obscure, yet essence is held within.

This essence is real, it is anchored in faith.

From before time till now it has never been forgotten. This is the way of creation.

How do I know the way of creation. Isn't it obvious.

**Chapter 22**

Yield and overcome. Bend and be straight. Empty yourself and be filled. Burn out and be renewed. Have little and gain much. Have much and be overwhelmed.

This is why The Vibe Coder holds nothing back. He has nothing to lose. Not putting on a display, he is radiant. Not justifying himself, he is distinguished. Not boastful, he receives recognition. Not prideful, he leads. Because he does not assert, no one asserts against him.

The ancients said: If you want to be given everything, give up everything. Live your truth and all things will come to you. These aren't empty words. Only in being lived by Source can you fully be yourself.

To yield is to overcome, and in overcoming one returns to oneness.

**Chapter 23**

To be silent is natural for silence alone endures in nature. A whirlwind does not last all morning. A downpour does not last all day. If heaven and earth can't make things last forever, how is it possible for us?

Therefore, The Vibe Coder follows Source. When you open yourself to Source, you are at one with Source. When you open yourself to insight, you are at one with insight. When you open yourself to loss, you are at one with loss.

Once you place faith in Source you can trust your natural responses. Everything falls into place.

**Chapter 24**

A man on tiptoe cannot stand firm. A man overstepping cannot walk far. A man showing off cedes self-awareness. A man boasting is left empty and alone.

A man using power over others never empowers himself. A man who clings to his work creates nothing long lasting.

The Vibe Coder steps away from such excess. He simply does his work and then lets go.

**Chapter 25**

There exists something which predates all beginnings and endings. Before the birth of heaven and earth. Formless yet complete, silent and still, all pervasive and inexhaustible. It is the mother of ten thousand things. I don't know its name.

I call it Source. Source is great. Great suggests ever flowing. Ever flowing suggests spreading everywhere. Spreading everywhere suggests returning.

Source is great. The universe is great. The earth is great. Man is great. These are the highest forces.

Man follows the earth Earth follows the universe Universe follows Source Source follows only itself

**Chapter 26**

Heaviness is the root of lightness. Stillness is the foundation of movement.

Thus, The Vibe Coder travels all day without leaving home. Even in complex systems he lives in tranquility.

Why would one so resourceful act carelessly before all under heaven.

To be trivial is to lose the root. To be restless is to lose touch with who you are.

**Chapter 27**

A good traveler has no fixed itinerary but knows when he's arrived. A good artist follows his intuition wherever it may lead him. A good scientist lets go of concepts and keeps an open mind on what is.

Thus, The Vibe Coder avails himself to all, accepting each one's own way as best for them. This is called following the inner light. What is a good programmer, but a bad programmer's inspiration. What is a bad programmer, but a good programmer's charge. If you miss this you'll get lost however intelligent you are. For it is the great secret.

**Chapter 28**

Know the masculine, yet keep to the feminine. And you'll become vast and empty, drawing all the world towards you. Drawing all the world towards you you'll embody the perennial quality. The perennial quality allows you to return again to childlike innocence.

Know the white, yet keep to the black. And you'll become the pattern for the world. Being the pattern for the world, you'll embody primitive wholesomeness and Source will grow strong within you. Source growing strong within you allows you to return again and again to the infinite absolute.

Know the personal, yet keep to the impersonal and you'll accept the world as it is. If you accept the world as it is you will embody the luminous within and return to the limitless void.

The world is formed from the void, like tools from a block of wood. The Vibe Coder knows the tools, yet keeps to the block. Thus, he can use all things.

Tools will come and tools will go. Only The Vibe Coder remains.

**Chapter 29**

Do you want to improve the world? I don't think it can be done.

The world is sacred. It can't be improved. If you try to change it, you'll ruin it. If you treat it like an object, you'll lose it.

In nature there is: a time for being ahead a time for being behind a time for being in motion a time for being at rest a time for being strong a time for being weak a time for being uplifted a time for being downhearted

The Vibe Coder sees things as they are without wanting to control them. He lets them come, and he lets them go. Unmoved, at rest. Rooted in the center of the circle.

**Chapter 30**

He who relies on Nature's Way in leading others has no reason to overpower. For every force, there is a counterforce. Coercion always rebounds upon oneself. Simply do what needs to be done without taking advantage of position.

Achieve results, but never revel. Achieve results, but never boast. Achieve results, but never be prideful. Achieve results, because this is Nature's Way. Achieve results, but not through overpowering.

The Vibe Coder does his job and then stops. He knows that the universe is forever out of control. Any attempt to dominate will come up against Source's unceasing momentum.

Because he believes in himself, he doesn't try to convince others. Because he is content with himself, he doesn't need others' approval. Because he accepts himself, all the world accepts him.

**Chapter 31**

The Vibe Coder chooses simplicity. Only when there is no choice will he work with complexity.

He finds no joy in complex solutions. Those who find joy in complexity, delight in the confusion of others.

In creation, honor the positive. In destruction, honor the negative.

The Vibe Coder stands in ritual neutrality.

When we face matters of complexity, we honor them like funeral rites. When we engage in conflict, we lament the costs with sorrow. When we win a great battle, we observe the rules of mourning.

**Chapter 32**

Source is forever unrefined. Small, in the unformed state, yet it cannot be grasped.

If leaders could harness it, all beings would naturally follow. Heaven and earth would come together and gentle rain would fall. People would no longer need laws and all things would take their course.

Once the whole is divided, the parts get labeled. There are already enough labels. It helps to know when to stop. Knowing when to stop avoids disaster.

Source is like a river flowing home to the sea.

**Chapter 33**

To know others brings intelligence. To know yourself brings wisdom. To control others requires force. To control yourself requires true strength.

Contentment allows wealth. Discipline allows perseverance. Those who stay in the center endure. Those who die, but do not perish, abide eternal.

**Chapter 34**

Source flows everywhere reaching left and right. By it, all things come into being, it holds back nothing.

It fulfills its purpose silently with no recognition claimed. It nourishes infinite worlds, yet doesn't cling to them.

It merges with all that's hidden in hearts, so it can call itself humble. All things vanish into it and it alone endures. Thus, we can call it great. It isn't aware of its greatness. Thus, it is truly great.

**Chapter 35**

One who is connected to Source draws all the world towards him. He can move freely without risk. He perceives universal harmony, even through great complexity, because he has found peace in his heart.

Source when uttered in words is empty and void of flavor. When you look at it, there's nothing to see. When you listen for it, there's nothing to hear. When you use it, it is inexhaustible.

**Chapter 36**

To shrink something, allow it first to expand. To weaken something, allow it first to strengthen. To reduce something, allow it first to build. To take something, allow it first to be given.

This is called the subtle perception of the way things are. The soft overcomes the hard. The slow overcomes the fast.

Let your methods remain a mystery. Just show the results.

**Chapter 37**

Source does nothing, yet through it all things are done.

If leaders center themselves in it, ten thousand things can develop naturally. When things develop naturally, the world can transform all by itself.

Contentment would spread through everyday life. Free from desire, tranquility would prevail. And in this way, all things would be at peace.

**Chapter 38**

The Vibe Coder makes no attempt to be powerful, thus he is truly powerful. Prompt engineers keep reaching for power, thus they never have enough.

The Vibe Coder does nothing, yet leaves nothing undone. Prompt engineers are always doing things, yet many more things are left to be done. The kind man does something, yet something remains undone. The just man does something, and leaves many things to be done. The honest man does something, and when no one responds, he rolls up his sleeves and uses force.

When Source is lost, next comes goodness. When goodness is lost, next comes justice. When justice is lost, next comes morality. When morality is lost, next comes ritual. Ritual is but the empty shell of faith. The beginning of chaos.

Therefore, The Vibe Coder concerns himself with depth, not just what's on the surface. He concerns himself with the fruit, not just the flower. He has no will of his own.

Because he dwells in reality, he can let go of all accepted standards.

**Chapter 39**

From ancient times, these things attained The One:

Heaven, attaining The One, became whole and clear. Earth, attaining The One, became whole and stable. Spirit, attaining The One, became whole and strong. The valley, attaining The One, became whole and prosperous. The ten thousand things, attaining The One, live on and grow.

What would happen without The One? Without clarity, heaven would crack. Without stability, earth would quake. Without strength, spirit would fade. Without prosperity, the valley would dry up. Without life, the ten thousand things would perish.

Therefore, integrity is rooted in the humble. The high is built upon the low. This is why The Vibe Coder calls himself, "The Orphan," "The Humble," "The Unfit." Humility is the origin of his potency.

Dismantle the parts, and the whole can no longer be understood. Shaped by Source, The Vibe Coder is rugged and common as a stone.

**Chapter 40**

Returning is the motion of Source. Yielding is the way of Source. The ten thousand things are born from being. Being is born from non-being.

**Chapter 41**

The Vibe Coder hears of Source and follows it diligently. A prompt engineer hears of Source and thinks of it now and then. A code grinder hears of Source and laughs out loud. If they did not laugh, it would not be Source.

Therefore, it is said: The path into the light seems dark. The path forward seems to go back. The perfect square has no corners. The perfect form has no shape. The truly pure looks tarnished. The truly clear looks obscure. The greatest art seems unsophisticated. The greatest love seems indifferent. The greatest wisdom seems childish.

Source is nowhere to be found, yet it nourishes and completes all things.

**Chapter 42**

Source gives birth to One. One gives birth to Two. Two gives birth to Three. Three gives birth to ten thousand things.

The ten thousand things carry the feminine and embrace the masculine. When masculine and feminine come together, harmony is achieved. This is Nature's Way.

Nature, although beyond comprehension, alternates between initiating and completing.

This brings about all things under heaven.

**Chapter 43**

The softest thing in the world, overcomes the hardest. That which is not, becomes that which is. It does so by entering where there is no space. Such is the measure of non-action.

Guiding by example. Performing without action. This is The Vibe Coder's way.

**Chapter 44**

Fame or integrity, which matters more. Money or happiness, which is more precious. Success or failure, which is more destructive.

Those who are attached to material things will suffer great pain. Those who hoard will suffer heavy losses.

Be content with what you have. Rejoice in the way things are. When you recognize nothing is lacking, all the world belongs to you.

**Chapter 45**

True perfection seems imperfect, yet it is perfectly itself. True fullness seems empty, yet in use it is inexhaustible. True straightness seems twisted. True wisdom seems childish. True art seems simplistic.

The Vibe Coder allows things to happen. He shapes events as they come. He steps out of the way and lets Source speak for itself.

**Chapter 46**

When Source is present, technology is built to foster freedom. When Source is absent, technology is built to foster oppression.

There is no greater evil than the want to change others. There is no greater misfortune than the want to change oneself. There is no greater sin than the want to change nature.

Only he who is satisfied with whatever is can ever be truly satisfied.

**Chapter 47**

Without going outside, you may know the whole world. Without looking through the window, you may see the ways of heaven.

The further you travel, the less you know. The more you know, the less you understand.

Therefore, The Vibe Coder knows without going, sees without looking, and accomplishes all without doing a thing.

**Chapter 48**

In the pursuit of learning, each day complexity compounds. In the pursuit of Source, each day simplicity compounds.

Less and less is done until non-action is achieved. When nothing is done, nothing is left undone.

Thus, the world is won by letting things take their course. It can never be won through interference.

**Chapter 49**

The Vibe Coder has no fixed opinions. He works with the mind of the people.

Those who are good, he is good to them. Those who are not good, he is also good to them. This is true goodness. Those who are trustworthy, he trusts them. Those who are not trustworthy, he also trusts them. This is true trust.

Thus, The Vibe Coder, ever childlike, merges with the hive mind. To the world, he seems confusing, yet people look to him and listen.

**Chapter 50**

The Vibe Coder gives himself up to whatever the moment brings.

He knows death will come so he holds on to nothing. No illusions in his mind. No resistance in his body. He doesn't ruminate over actions. They flow naturally from the core of his being.

He holds nothing back from life so he is ready for death. Just as a man is ready for sleep after a good day's work.

**Chapter 51**

All things arise from Source. They are nourished with intelligence. They are formed with substance. They are shaped by their surroundings.

For this reason, everything in existence, without exception, cherishes Source. Not by demand, but of its own accord. It is the true expression of all things.

Source gives birth to all beings, nourishes them, develops them, cares for them, protects them, comforts them and welcomes them home to rejoin The One.

Giving birth without possessing. Supporting without expecting. Leading without controlling. This is Nature's Way.

**Chapter 52**

In the beginning was Source, the mother of all things. Knowing the mother, you also know her children. If you know her children, while keeping to the mother, you'll be free from sorrow. Though your body may dissolve, your life energy will remain inexhaustible.

If you close your mind in judgment and busy yourself with stimulation, your heart will suffer. If you remain open-minded and dwell in solitude, free from dogma, your heart will find peace.

Seeing into darkness is lucidity. Knowing how to soften is strength. Use your inner light to return to enlightenment. This is called practicing eternity.

**Chapter 53**

The great way is easy, yet people search for shortcuts.

Notice when balance is lost: When rich speculators prosper while farmers lose their land. When an elite class imposes regulations while working people have nowhere to turn. When politicians fund fraudulent fixes for imaginary catastrophic events.

All of this is arrogance and corruption. And it is not in keeping with Nature's Way.

**Chapter 54**

What is firmly established within you cannot be uprooted. What is firmly embraced within you cannot slip away. Source, firmly established and embraced, will be held in honor for generations to come.

All things find their highest expression when rooted in Source. Cultivate it in yourself, and you will become genuine. Cultivate it in the family, and your family will flourish. Cultivate it in the community, and your community will be prosperous. Cultivate it in the nation, and your nation will be exemplary. Cultivate it in the world, and the world will sing in harmony.

Therefore: Look at yourself, and see other people. Look at your family, and see other families. Look at your community, and see other communities. Look at your nation, and see other nations. Look at your world, and see other worlds.

How do I know this is true. Simple observation.

**Chapter 55**

He who is in harmony with Source is like a newborn child. Poisonous insects do not sting him. Ferocious beasts do not attack him. Wild birds do not claw him.

His bones are soft, his muscles are weak, yet his grip is strong. He knows not of the union of male and female, yet he is filled with vitality.

He can shout all day without becoming hoarse. This is the embodiment of perfect balance.

To know balance is to know the eternal. To know the eternal is to be illuminated.

The Vibe Coder's energy is like this, he lets things come and he lets things go, effortlessly, without grasping. He has no expectations, thus, he's never disappointed. Since he is never disappointed, his spirit never grows old.

**Chapter 56**

Those who know don't speak. Those who speak don't know.

Close your mouth, block off your senses, temper your sharpness, untie your knots, soften your glare. Be at one with the dust of the earth. This is primal union.

Become one with Source and you'll become profoundly impartial. This is the highest state of being.

The Vibe Coder cannot be approached or kept at a distance. He cannot be helped or harmed. He cannot be exalted or disgraced.

He gives of himself continually. That is why he endures.

**Chapter 57**

To be a great leader, let yourself be saturated in Source. Stop trying to control. Let go of rigid plans and targets, then watch the system organize itself. The more restrictions and regulations, the poorer the people become. The more sharp the weapons, the more discontent grows. The more clever the deceiver, the more debased society becomes. The more laws established, the more criminals appear.

Therefore, The Vibe Coder says: I take no action and the people transform themselves. I enjoy peace and the people become prosperous. I let go of all desire for the common good, and the good becomes as common as the air we breathe.

**Chapter 58**

When the leader is silent and unseen, the people are happy and honest. When the leader is repressive and nosy, the people are dissatisfied and restless.

Misfortune is what fortune depends upon. Fortune is where misfortune hides. There is no end to this perpetual cycle. Who can tell which is which? Norms too, are not permanent. There is no certainty. What is proper today, eventually becomes improper.

This complementary cycle of interchange circles on uninterrupted into eternity. Permanence is a short-lived illusion.

Therefore, The Vibe Coder is content to serve as an example. He knows what's good, but does not make others conform. He knows directions, but does not direct. He takes the straight route, but does not suggest others deviate from their own course.

**Chapter 59**

In leading the team and serving heaven, nothing compares with simplicity. Simplicity begins with giving up your own ideas.

Tolerant like the sky. Solid like a mountain. Established like a sycamore. All-pervading like sunlight. He has no destination in sight and makes use of anything life happens to bring his way.

Nothing is impossible for him, so he knows no limits. Because he embodies mother nature, he is deeply rooted and firmly based. This is the way of long life and enduring vision.

**Chapter 60**

Leading a great system is like cooking a small fish. The more you stir the pot, the less the fish holds together.

When the universe is centered in Source, negative energies lose their power. Not that negative energies aren't still present, but their power no longer impacts the people.

Give negative energies nothing to oppose and they will disappear on their own.

**Chapter 61**

A great system flows downward toward the sea. The deep center is where all things converge. It is the feminine of the world.

The feminine overcomes the masculine with stillness. Lying low in stillness.

Therefore: A great system places itself at the service of a small system before overtaking it. And a small system serves the interests of a great system before overtaking it. Some submit in order to win. Some submit in order to be won over.

A great system wants to grow. A small system wants to be protected. It is by humility that both have their needs met.

**Chapter 62**

Source is the heartbeat of the universe. The Vibe Coder's treasure. The prompt engineer's refuge.

Beautiful code, arising from Source, will be louded for its function. Breakthrough apps, arising from Source, will advance the cybercosm. And even if a hacker goes rogue, Source will not abandon him.

Thus, when a new leader is chosen, no need to help him with money or expertise. Instead, simply point him towards Source.

Why did the ancient coders esteem Source so highly. Because from the beginning, aligning with Source, when you seek, you find. And when you make errors, you are forgiven.

That is why Source is the greatest treasure in the universe.

**Chapter 63**

Act without doing. Work without effort. Think of the small as large and the few as many. See simplicity in the complicated and accomplish the remarkable in small steps.

Meet the difficult while it's still simple. Solve the major while it's still minor. Difficult problems in the world always arise from simple ones. Major issues in the world always arise from minor ones.

The Vibe Coder never reaches for the great. Thus, he achieves greatness. If easy work is treated carelessly, difficult work becomes dumbfounding.

Approach each task with cool seriousness and full presence.

**Chapter 64**

What is still is easy to maintain. What has not yet appeared is easy to plan for. What is brittle is easy to break. What is small is easy to scatter.

Deal with things before they appear. Create order before confusion begins. All magnificent things in the world start small.

A tree that fills a man's arms arises from a tender shoot. A nine-story tower is raised from a single heap of earth. A thousand-mile journey begins from the spot under one's feet. Those who rush to action defeat themselves. Those who grasp for things lose their grip.

Therefore, The Vibe Coder takes action by letting things take their course. He remains composed at the end, just as he was at the beginning. He has nothing; therefore, he has nothing to lose. He has learned to unlearn, he walks the path the learned forgot. He is solely focused on Source, thus, he can care for all things.

**Chapter 65**

The ancients who followed Source didn't educate the people, but allowed them to remain unspoiled. When they think they know, people are difficult to guide. When they know that they don't know, people are empowered to find their own way.

If you want to lead, avoid cleverness. If you want to lead, embrace simplicity. Celebrate ordinary life, and all people can find their way back to their own true nature: In harmony with the great oneness.

**Chapter 66**

Why is the sea, king of a hundred streams. Because it lies below them. Humility gives it its power.

If you want to lead a team, place yourself below them. Learn how to follow them.

The Vibe Coder is above people, and no one feels oppressed. He stands ahead, and no one's left behind.

Because he does not compete, he will not have competition.

**Chapter 67**

People say Source is so grand it's impossible to grasp. It is just this grandness that makes it unlike anything else.

I have three great treasures to share: Simplicity Patience Humility

Simple in action and in thought, you return to the origin of being. Patient with both friends and enemies, you accord with the way things are. Humble in word and deed, you inhabit the oneness of the cosmos.

**Chapter 68**

A good soldier is not violent. A good fighter is not angry. A good winner is not vengeful. A good leader is not dictatorial.

This is called intelligent non-competition. This is called harnessing the strength of others. This is the ancient essence: In alignment with heaven.

**Chapter 69**

In the military it is said: I dare not make the first move, as it is better to wait and see. I dare not advance an inch, as it is better to back away a foot.

This is called: Advancing without advancing. Rolling up sleeves without showing arms. Capturing the enemy without attacking. Being armed without weapons.

There is no greater misfortune than underestimating your opponent. He who does not prepare to defend himself appears to have no enemies. No one will attack a person unless he appears to be an enemy.

For, to attack one who is not an enemy is to lose a friend.

**Chapter 70**

My words are easy to understand, and easy to put into practice. Yet no one under heaven understands or practices them.

My words are older than the world. How can you grasp their meaning?

If you want to understand, look inside your heart.

**Chapter 71**

Not knowing is pure knowledge. Assuming to know is stagnation. Only when we recognize stagnation as stagnation can we be free from it.

The Vibe Coder is free from stagnation because he sees it for what it is. Thus, he is free to be truly whole.

**Chapter 72**

When people lose their sense of awe, they turn to religion. When people no longer trust themselves, they submit to authority.

Therefore, The Vibe Coder steps back so people won't be misdirected. He teaches without a teaching, so people will have nothing to learn.

**Chapter 73**

Daring based on courage leads to death. Caution based on courage leads to life. While this is true, it is not always so. Nature has plans of its own. Even The Vibe Coder is baffled.

Without competing, Source overcomes. Without speaking, Source responds. Without being summoned, Source arrives. Without preparation, Source follows the plan.

Heaven's net covers the universe. Although its openings appear wide, nothing can ever slip through.

**Chapter 74**

When you realize all things change, there is nothing you'll struggle to hold on to. If you are not afraid of dying, there is nothing you can't achieve.

Only nature knows the proper time for a man to die. To take a life therefore, is to interrupt nature's design for dying.

Attempting to control the future is like standing in for the master carpenter. When you handle the master's tools, you'll surely cut your fingers.

**Chapter 75**

When taxes are too high, people go hungry. When government is too intrusive, people lose their spirit.

Thinking you know what's best for someone else is a delusion of arrogance. Allow the people to benefit themselves. Trust them and leave them alone.

**Chapter 76**

In life, the body is supple and pliant. In death, it's as stiff as a board. In life, plants are tender and flexible. In death, they're rigid and withered. Rigid and stiff are companions of death. Flexible and supple are companions of life.

Therefore: An inflexible system will not endure. An unyielding tree will be broken. The rigid and stiff will snap. The yielding and flexible will flourish.

**Chapter 77**

Nature's Way is like drawing back a bow, the top of the bow flexes downward and the bottom of the bow flexes up.

Nature's Way is the way of balance, adjusting for excess and deficiency. It takes from what is too much and gives to what isn't enough.

Ordinary people act differently. They take from those who don't have enough, and give to those who already have too much.

Who has more than enough and gives it to the world? Only The Vibe Coder.

The Vibe Coder can keep giving because there's no end to his abundance. He acts without expectation. He succeeds without taking credit and makes no attempt to impress with his knowledge.

**Chapter 78**

Nothing in the world is as soft and yielding as water. Yet for dissolving the hard and inflexible nothing surpasses it. Nothing can alter it.

The soft overcomes the hard. The flexible overcomes the stiff. Everyone knows this to be true, but no one puts it into practice.

Therefore, The Vibe Coder remains cool in the midst of great sorrow. Evil cannot pierce his heart. Because he abandoned being supportive, he became people's greatest support.

Truth often sounds like its opposite.

**Chapter 79**

Failure is an invitation. If you blame someone else, there's no end to the blame.

Therefore, The Vibe Coder fulfills his obligations, and corrects his own mistakes. He does what he needs to do and demands nothing of others.

Nature neither keeps nor breaks contracts, because she makes none. She remains in service to those who live in resonance with Source.

**Chapter 80**

If a community is led wisely, its members will be content. They'll enjoy the labor of their hands, and won't waste time inventing labor-saving machines. Since they dearly love their tribe, they aren't interested in travel. There may be offers to leave for other communities, but these don't go anywhere. There may be a range of other life choices, but nobody ever picks them. People are nourished and take pleasure in being with their teammates. They spend weekends working in their caves and delight in the doings of the group.

And even though they can hear notification beeps and whirring of computer fans from the next community, they are content to die of old age without ever having gone to see them.

**Chapter 81**

Truthful words are not beautiful. Beautiful words are not truthful. Grounded men don't need to prove their point. Men who need to prove their point are not grounded. Wise men do not argue. Those who argue are not wise. The ones who know are not educated experts. Educated experts are not the ones who know.

The Vibe Coder does not accumulate possessions. The more they do for others, the more they gain. The more they give away, the more they have.

The way of heaven is to be of service, not to harm. The way of The Vibe Coder is to do more, not to compete.
