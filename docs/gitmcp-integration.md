# GitMCP.io Integration Guide
## Seamless AI Context for The Way of Code

*"The highest good is like water. Water nourishes the ten thousand things without effort."* - Chapter 8

## üåä Overview

GitMCP.io transforms The Way of Code repository into an instant MCP server, providing seamless access to our philosophical coding principles through any AI assistant. This integration embodies the principle of **Flow Over Force** - no complex setup, just natural access to wisdom.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Universal URL
```
https://gitmcp.io/mgd1984/the-way-of-code
```

Simply replace `github.com` with `gitmcp.io` in our repository URL to create an instant MCP server.

      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": []
    }
  }
}
```

## üéØ Available Tools

GitMCP.io provides several tools for accessing The Way of Code:

### `fetch_the-way-of-code_documentation`
Retrieves the primary documentation (our `llms.txt` file) containing comprehensive project context.

**Example Usage:**
```typescript
// AI assistant automatically calls this for general questions
"What is The Way of Code about?"
```

### `search_the-way-of-code_documentation`
Searches through our documentation for specific topics or principles.

**Example Usage:**
```typescript
// AI searches for relevant principles
"How should I approach debugging complex problems?"
```

### `search_the-way-of-code_code`
Searches through our codebase for implementation examples.

**Example Usage:**
```typescript
// AI finds code examples
"Show me how the MCP server is implemented"
```

### `fetch_url_content`
Retrieves content from links referenced in our documentation.

## üîÑ Dual Integration Strategy

We maintain both local MCP server and GitMCP.io integration:

### Local Server Benefits
- Full control over functionality
- Custom tools and features
- Offline access
- Development and testing

### GitMCP.io Benefits
- Zero setup for users
- Universal accessibility
- Always current
- No maintenance overhead

## üåê Public Access

Our GitMCP.io integration makes The Way of Code accessible to anyone:

### Badge Integration
We include the GitMCP badge in our README:
```markdown
[![GitMCP](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://gitmcp.io/badge/mgd1984/the-way-of-code)](https://gitmcp.io/mgd1984/the-way-of-code)
```
