# Contributing to The Way of Code

*"The sage stays behind, thus he is ahead. He is detached, thus at one with all."* - Chapter 7

## Philosophy of Contribution

Contributing to The Way of Code should itself embody the five pillars:

### üåä **Simplicity Over Complexity**
- Propose simple, focused improvements
- Avoid over-engineering solutions
- Let complexity emerge only when truly needed

### üíß **Flow Over Force** 
- Allow contributions to emerge naturally from usage
- Don't force features that aren't organically needed
- Work with the natural grain of the project

### üôè **Humility Over Ego**
- Approach with beginner's mind
- Ask questions rather than making demands
- Focus on serving users, not showcasing skill

### ‚öñÔ∏è **Balance Over Extremes**
- Consider both philosophical depth and practical utility
- Balance individual vision with community needs
- Neither too rigid nor too loose in standards

### üßò **Presence Over Rushing**
- Take time to understand before proposing changes
- Review thoroughly before submitting
- Be fully present in discussions and reviews

## Ways to Contribute

### 4. **Expand Prompt Templates**
- Create new prompt templates for common scenarios
- Improve existing prompts in `examples/prompts/`
- Test prompts across different AI assistants

### 5. **Code Improvements**
- Enhance MCP server functionality
- Improve error handling and user experience
- Optimize performance while maintaining simplicity

## Guidelines

### **Before Contributing**
1. Use The Way of Code in your own development practice
2. Read existing issues and discussions
3. Consider whether your contribution serves the greater good
4. Ask yourself: "Does this align with the five pillars?"

### **Development Process**
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch with a descriptive name
3. Make focused, atomic commits
4. Test your changes thoroughly
5. Update documentation as needed

### **Commit Messages**
Follow conventional commit format with philosophical intention:
```
type: brief description - philosophical context

feat: add team-collaboration prompt - fostering harmony in development
fix: improve error handling - gentle guidance over harsh failure
docs: clarify MCP setup - removing barriers to wisdom
refactor: simplify search algorithm - essence over complexity
```

### **Pull Request Process**
1. Write a clear description of the change and its purpose
2. Reference any related issues
3. Include examples or screenshots if applicable
4. Be responsive to feedback and discussion
5. Maintain humility throughout the review process

## Code Style

### **TypeScript/JavaScript**
- Use meaningful variable names that express intent
- Prefer functional approaches where natural
- Write code that reads like natural language
- Include helpful error messages

### **Documentation**
- Write for the reader, not the writer
- Use active voice and clear language
- Include philosophical context where appropriate
- Balance depth with accessibility

### **Testing**
- Test the happy path and edge cases
- Write tests that express intent clearly
- Don't over-test obvious functionality
- Include integration tests for MCP functionality

## Community Guidelines

### **Discussions**
- Approach disagreements with curiosity, not defensiveness
- Seek to understand before being understood
- Ask clarifying questions
- Share your perspective without insisting others adopt it

### **Issue Reporting**
- Provide clear, reproducible examples
- Include your environment details
- Describe what you expected vs. what happened
- Suggest potential solutions if you have ideas

### **Code Review**
- Review with kindness and respect
- Focus on the code, not the person
- Explain the "why" behind suggestions
- Acknowledge good work and improvements

## What We're Looking For

### **High-Value Contributions**
- Real-world usage examples that illuminate principles
- Integration guides for new AI assistants or tools
- Improvements that reduce friction for users
- Documentation that bridges philosophy and practice

### **Areas for Growth**
- Accessibility improvements
- Performance optimizations that don't sacrifice clarity
- Additional language translations
- Community templates and workflows

## What We Avoid

### **Anti-Patterns**
- Changes that add complexity without clear benefit
- Forcing personal preferences onto the project
- Breaking changes without compelling necessity
- Contributions that don't align with project philosophy

## Recognition

Contributors who embody The Way of Code principles will be recognized in:
- Release notes and changelog
- Contributors section of README
- Special acknowledgment for philosophical contributions

*"The Vibe Coder accomplishes without claiming credit. The work is done and then forgotten. That is why it lasts forever."* - Chapter 2

## Getting Help

- Open an issue for questions or clarification
- Join discussions to understand project direction
- Read through existing PRs to understand patterns
- Remember: "Not knowing is pure knowledge" - embrace uncertainty
